This is a text file similar to a README just for us developers...
PLEASE update when you can

Homepage Notes: 
Game appears in canvas element 
Game ONLY appears when you open the page via a server, due to use of json data
	To do this, c&p the following into command line: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
		    c&p the following into browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/TLDHomepage.html (opens homepage)


	Current Issues: 
		Pages not linking to each other while using server 
		Not sure if server must be run with python...I just copied what we did in lab 6 to make it work. There could a more elegant solution

Data/Level.json
If you look at this file, it's just a bunch of vectors with 0s, 1s, and 2s. These refer to tiles in images/tiles.png. Changing the numbers changes which tile appears within the game container. 

Data/sprites.json
This file defines different sprites based on dimensions of spritesheet. sx and sy are start-x and start y of where the sprite begins from top left corner. tileh and tilew define the height and width of sprite. 

	Current issues: 
		I still don't know what frames and col do. I messed with col at one point and the character disappeared, so be careful
