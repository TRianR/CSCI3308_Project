###Who: 
* Tyler Rostenbach, Cassie Souza, Tyler Glotz, Jessica Evans, Meri Burgess

###Title: 
* Timmy's Lost Dimension 

###Description:
* "Timmy's Lost Dimension" (working title) is a 2D side-scroller platform based game accessed on a web browser. It is about a boy named Timmy who wanders through a portal and gets lost in various parallel dimensions.  Every level, you encounter various elements and are awarded points based on time.
The website will also include a forum and a scoreboard. 

###Vision Statement 
* We are making a dynamic game with a rich user experience that is entertaining and fun. 

###Motivation:
* To gain experience in web design, web app design, and game design while focusing on a project that is entertaining to us as developers as well as users. 

###Risks:
* Design creep : too many feature ideas
* Lack of experience in making games (none)
* Unfamiliar with code language 
* Lots of other schoolwork/projects/jobs 
* Coordinating between 5 people and their schedules

###Mitigation Strategy:
* Designated time to get together and work as a group
* Utilize various forms of virtual communication to keep in touch
* Utilize resources online to learn as we work
* Design/strategize our methodology to prevent design creep
